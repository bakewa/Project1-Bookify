# Project Description
Build any type of web application from the ground up. 

# My Web Application - A Personal Library
Here is what I have included in my web app. 
- Models: In this web application I used 3 models. Author, User and Work
- Handling Validation: Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
- User Login: I've included the basic authentication and authorization when interacting with users. 
- What I used to make this web app work included:
    * Ruby on Rails
    * Bootstrap 

# Function of the Web App
The function of this web app was to act as a personal book library. This would require the users to either create an account or sign in to be able to create their library of adding their favourrite authors and books. 

Features Include: 
- User validation and authentication
- Making an admin that is able to access all users who have signed up 
- Creating new authors that requires the user to enter the name and image of the new author. 
- Creating new works that requires the user to enter the title and image of the new book and name of author. 

# Errors/Blockers/What's not working 🚫
- At the moment what's not really working is making the books (works) appear on the Works page and it instead a form for creating a new work appears instead.
- Under the authors profile, instead of the book covers appearing under their name, its a duplicate image of the author.  

# Learning Experience
- Create a clear plan of what you want. E.g. what features you want. 
- Before creating your app tables and migrations, be 100% certain of the type of data you want and map out your associations. 
- By working through errors, I've slowly gained a clearer understanding of Ruby on Rails. 
- Try not to work on your web apps til 2am.😅

# Future Updates
- In future updates I would like to be able to add more features that allows the user to create different booklists and be able to add a book to whatever booklist they want. 
- Ultimately I would love for the layout of this web application to resemble the Spotify layout just because I like Spotify. =)
