# Project Description
Build any type of web application from the ground up. 

# My Web Application - A Personal Library
Here is what I have included in my web app. 
- Models: In this web application I used 3 models. Author, User and Work
- Handling Validation: Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
- User Login: I've included the basic authentication and authorization when interacting with users. 
- What I used to make this web app work included:
    * Ruby on Rails
    * Bootstrap 

# Function of the Web App
The function of this web app was to act as a personal book library. This would require the users to either create an account or sign in to be able to create their library of adding their favourrite authors and books. 

Features Include
- User validation and authentication
- Making an admin that is able to access all users who have signed up 
- Creating new authors that requires the user to enter the name and image of the new author. 
- Creating new works that requires the user to enter the title and image of the new book and name of author. 

# Future Updates
- In future updates I would like to be able to add a feature that allows the user to create different booklists and be able to add a book to whatever booklist they want. 
- Ultimately I would love for the layout of this web application to resemble the Spotify layout. =)
